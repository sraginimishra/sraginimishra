### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

Here I have attached some files to get staerted with the project for AutoComplete Search.
Create a Database, Here I am using Xampp database called phpmyadmin.
I have attached a file called tbl_country where I have given sql codes to get the database i am using here.
Insert the elemnts.
Then save the files with name given and same extensions.
Run into your local server to see the demo.
Here I am adding a screenshot.
Your sugggetsions are always welcome!
Thankyou
